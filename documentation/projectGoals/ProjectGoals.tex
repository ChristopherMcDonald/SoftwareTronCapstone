\section{Project Summary}
The project will be a table tennis trainer, comprising of a shooting mechanism, computer vision system and machine learning recommendation algorithm.
\section{Success Criteria}
The following items are required to be completed for this project to be a success:
\begin{itemize}
\item The system can detect the boundaries of the table to determine valid returns on the system's side
\item The system can detect valid returns from the user with an accuracy of 90\%
\item The system can hit each square of a 4x4 grid with an accuracy of 75\%
\item The system can apply a reinforcement learning algorithm to aid in the shot decision
\item The system can pause and resume operation
\item The system can calibrate its position and orientation
\item The system can adjust the shooting frequency
\end{itemize}
\section{Mid-Level Goals}
\begin{itemize}
\item The system can detect the boundaries of the table to determine valid shot locations on the user's side
\item The system can hit each square of a 8x8 grid with an accuracy of 75\%
\item The system can calibrate its shooting parametres
\item The system can notify the user of their performance after each shot is taken
\item The system has multiple modes including `single-shot' and random
\item The system has leaderboards for all users
\item The system's state persists after shutting down
\item The system can apply spin to the shot on one axis
\item The system can shoot at various speeds
\end{itemize}
\section{High-Level Goals}
\begin{itemize}
\item The system can hit each square of a 16x16 grid with an accuracy of 75\%
\item The system can apply spin to the shot on a combination of two axes
\item The system can track the ball throughout the complete path travelled across the table
\item The system can collect the balls returned by the user
\item The system can shoot from different heights
\end{itemize}
