\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Project Overview}
SmartServe is an autonomous table tennis training system for table tennis players with various skill levels. SmartServe aids in diagnosing and improving a player's performance over time. The system trains table tennis players by shooting table tennis balls towards the player and detects successful returns from the player. The system can further adapt to the player's weaknesses and help them overcome it through further training. Importantly, SmartServe alleviates the problems of finding and working with a coach for players, as well as coaches trying to train multiple players simultaneously. The system will be deemed a success if the table tennis players and coaches can enjoy and see some value added by using SmartServe.\\\\
The project started at the beginning of the Fall 2017 academic term and will conclude at the end of the Winter 2018 term. In addition, the core project team consists of final year Software and Mechatronics Engineering students who are enrolled in the MECHTRON 4TB6/SFWRENG 4G06 capstone project course.
\subsection{Document Overview}
The purpose of this document is to provide an overview of the system design which meets the system requirements as specified in the \href{run:../Requirements/Requirements.pdf}{Requirements Document}. The system will be decomposed into subsystems, where each has responsibilities and is designed to fulfill certain requirements. The subsystems will have their intended input, expected output and description of how the module will be used. In further documentation, each will be designed in a way which is abstracted from this document's perspective. The expected use cases will also be detailed to understand the expectations of the user and how each subsystem interacts with one another. A more detailed view of this including timing as a factor will be detailed in the Sequence Diagram section. \\ \\ % TODO LINK EVERYTHING
For each subsystem, its purpose will be defined with respect to the overall system. After doing so, detailed input and output parameters will be defined. How each subsystem is architected is out of scope for this document and will be defined in further documentation. \\ \\

\begin{figure}[H]

   \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{img/Table-Tennis-Top-View.png} %requires the graphicx package

   \label{fig:table-tennis-top-view}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Project Scope}
The system will only attempt to shoot balls from the shooting mechanism straight towards the user side. Notably, the system will not attempt to return any shots from the user. After the user has returned a shot, the Computer Vision (CV) subsystem will be utilized to determine if the user's shot lands on the table or not. Additionally, the characteristics of the shot following any return will be determined by the system's mode and the proficiency of the player if available.
\subsection{Assumptions}
This design assumes the user supplies a functioning webcam, a capable computer to run the software and can connect to the SmartServe system via USB. The computer should have proficient computing power, as the CV subsystem will suffer in proficiency as a result. It is also assumed the use cases described here cover all interactions the user will attempt to have with the system. We assume the user has a ITTF-approved table, an orange table tennis ball and a paddle to use.
\section{System Description}
\subsection{System Architecture}
The system will follow a service-oriented architecture. This means that a central subsystem will interface with several services that serve a single purpose. Some subsystems will be simply told what needs to be done and others will be asked for some return value. This is done to implement separation of concerns where one subsystem doesn't know everything about the system and only what is necessary to satisfy their requirements. It also allows for easy increments of versioning, where one subsystem can be used as long as it is functional and easily swapped out for a newer version with extra features or increased performance. Moreover, this system has heavy timing constraints and an unpredictable environment so some actions must be taken in absence of a service's response. For example, the computer vision may take longer to track a ball depending on its trajectory where the system must shoot another ball in order to keep the user engaged.

\subsection{Subsystems}
The system will be broken down into subsystems with the following purposes: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{SmartServe}: general management of subsystems
\item \textbf{Computer Vision}:  detection of returns
\item \textbf{Shooting Mechanism}:  shooting the ball toward the user
\item \textbf{Shot Recommendation}: provides best shot
\item \textbf{Data Storage}: storing the data
\item \textbf{Shooting Model}: modelling the shot's trajectory
\item \textbf{User Interface}: taking input from the user and showing output
\end{itemize}
The diagram for this breakdown can be found in Figure \ref{fig:sub}.
\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{img/Subsystem.png} % requires the graphicx package
   \caption{Subsystem Breakdown}
   \label{fig:sub}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Use Cases}
The diagram including all use cases can be found in Figure \ref{fig:usecase}. The user-instantiated ones will be described in detail below.
\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/UseCase.png} % requires the graphicx package
   \caption{Use Case Diagram}
   \label{fig:usecase}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Start Training}
The user interface will have ways to allow the user to start this action which makes the Smart Serve subsystem prepare for a shot to shoot towards the user. To do this, it needs to request a shot to use from the Shot Recommendation subsystem. The shot includes the following parameters: desired location on the table, the speed of the shot and the angular velocity of the ball. The Smart Serve subsystem can then use the Shooting Model to translate this information into pitch, yaw and angular velocity to shoot the ball so it matches the desired shot. After doing so, it will instruct the shooting mechanism to shoot the ball with the appropriate parameters and start the CV subsystem to begin tracking for a successful return. Only until the CV subsystem returns the pass or failed return data, can it update the Data Storage and Shot Recommendation subsystems with this new information. The former will store the result and the data for the shot together, where the latter will update the model used to generate shot recommendations. Upon completion, it can begin preparing for a new shot.

   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/SequenceDiagram-Start.png}
   \caption{Sequence Diagram for Starting Training}
   \label{fig:start}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Stop Training}
In the event the user wants to cease training, the user interface will allow this and will halt the system from shooting balls. No data should be written nor shots requested for the shooting mechanism to shoot in order to preserve the integrity of the data being gathered.
\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/SequenceDiagram-Stop.png}
   \caption{Sequence Diagram for Ceasing Training}
   \label{fig:stop}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{View Results}
When the user wants to visualize the results of their performance, the user interface should be used. It will use the Smart Serve subsystem to query data from Data Storage and present it in some meaningful way.
\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/SequenceDiagram-View.png}
   \caption{Sequence Diagram for Viewing Training Results}
   \label{fig:view}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Tune Parameters}
The system may need to be adjusted for various lighting, table sizes or environments. The user interface will allow a system administrator to do this in order to directly change values associated for these variables.
\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/SequenceDiagram-Tune.png}
   \caption{Sequence Diagram for Tuning Parameters}
   \label{fig:tune}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Start System}
The user interface will allow the system to be booted which will start the Smart Serve subsystem. This will allow the Shot Recommendation system to build its model based on previous data for the user, if it exists.
\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/SequenceDiagram-Boot.png}
   \caption{Sequence Diagram for Booting the System}
   \label{fig:boot}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Behaviour Description}
As the behaviour of the system has been discussed previously, this section will describe the expected user behaviour and how they will interact with the system.
\subsubsection{Normal Operation}
The trainee would begin by starting the system from its off state. This will trigger the Start System use case. The user will then trigger the Start Training use case and specify a training mode. This creates the loop of Smart Serve prepping and serving shots for the user. Only until the user triggers the Stop System use case will this loop stop during normal operation. During or after training a user can start the View Data use case to get details on their performance.
\subsubsection{Abnormal Operation}
Although possible, there are some actions a user could take which would be considered abnormal. If a user hits the ball and it immediately leaves the viewable area of the computer vision, whether it never returns or does so after 1.5 seconds, it should be considered a failed return. A user could also replace the table with a different one without calibrating the system to the new table. Furthermore, the user could misplace the system such that it is not centre with the table or at the edge of the table. The proper placement can be found in Figure \ref{fig:table-tennis-top-view}. The system will require the user to load the balls into the shooting mechanism's hopper which will need to be a particular size and colour to work optimally.
\subsubsection{Error Handling}
If the system should encounter an error, it should display the details of it through the User Interface subsystem. In addition to this, it must take measures to ensure the safety of the user and integrity of the system. This includes stopping all training and pending actions for the system to perform. Examples of such errors include a jammed table tennis ball, and an empty mechanism ball hopper.
\subsection{Likely Changes}
Some aspects of the system design will likely change as the project progresses which will be excluded within this document. This is done so the design is considered complete and the next stages of design and implementation can be done. The first likely change would be to the computer vision subsystem, as the introduction of another camera would change the high level design of this subsystem. The additional camera would track a 3rd dimension, which is along the short side of the table. This change would propagate through the system since the Shot Recommendation subsystem would need to consider this new data for recommending new shots. The Data Storage subsystem will also be changed to hold the new data.
\subsection{Unlikely Changes}
The overall architecture of the system will not change, although additional subsystems could be added or existing ones could be changed. The degrees of freedom for a shot will not change. The Smart Serve subsystem will likely not change, although the data being processed between states may change. 
\section{Subsystems Overview}
\subsection{Smart Serve}
The Smart Serve subsystem will provide the means of interfacing with all the subsystems and enforcing timing constraints. For all intents and purposes, it can be considered the main process and hub of the system. In the event a subsystem is taking too long to respond, this subsystem must be able to continue operation to meet timing requirements. The various states and transitions can be found in Figure \ref{fig:fsm}. The FSM (Finite State Machine) diagram shows each state should have an \textit{exit option} if a service takes longer than allowed to preform an action.
\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{img/FSM.png}
   \caption{Smart Serve FSM}
   \label{fig:fsm}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Computer Vision}
The Computer Vision subsystem will be a service to the Smart Serve subsystem to determine if a shot is successfully returned. When sent a request to begin tracking the ball, it will do so and return a true when the ball bounces off the table or false when it doesn't. In the event the ball never enters frame, it will assume the return was failed after a fixed amount of time. \\ \\
The FSM will be updated every frame captured within the CV subsystem. Once a frame is captured, the position of the ball will be compared against the previous position and a difference in position can be calculated. Based on how it moved, the state of the FSM will or will not change. Since the ball is being viewed on the System's side, a valid return is when it is moving towards the system, travels downward and then upward while still in frame. The states and transitions of the FSM represent this.
\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{img/cvFSM.png}
   \caption{CV Finite State Machine}
   \label{fig:cv}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Shot Recommendation}
The Shot Recommendation subsystem will be a service to the Smart Serve subsystem to determine which shot should be taken next. The way the subsystem decides on the shot will be determined by the training mode the user selects. These will include shooting the same shot every time, pseudo-randomly picking a shot or using reinforcement learning algorithms to decide the next shot. The last mode will be based on previous performance by the user. \\ \\
The training mode will utilize a variation of a Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. The subsystem will attempt to predict the actual return rate for each type of shot for a particular player by holding a range of values the actual return rate exists within. The initial state is from 0 - 100\% and the range for a individual shot closes when the shot is attempted. The minimum will rise if it is returned successfully and the maximum is lowered if the player misses it. When a shot is needed, the subsystem will select one shot from the shots with the lowest minimum bound since they have the highest chance of being the player's weakest points. This provides the important benefit of exploring different shots at the beginning and exploiting some later in the training phase. 
\subsection{Shooting Model}
The Shooting Model subsystem will be a service to the Smart Serve subsystem which provides the means of mapping a desired shot to the details needed to take the shot. The input and output for the system can be found in Figure \ref{fig:shotmodel}. The output will be an array of many combinations of pitch, yaw, speed and angular velocity that satisfy the input shot details.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{img/ShotModel.png} % requires the graphicx package
   \caption{Shooting Model I/O}
   \label{fig:shotmodel}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Data Storage}
The Data Storage subsystem will store all the details for each shot, the user's profile and the return rates for each user. It will need to have interfaces for saving data and querying data out of the system in a variety of formats. Ideally, it will require minimal detail and configuration for the subsystem which uses it due to the variety of implementations of these subsystems.
\subsection{User Interface}
The User Interface subsystem will be the means of translating user requests into actionable requests for the Smart Serve subsystem. The inputs will include a username, password, mode selection and some means of starting and stopping the training. The UI will also need to accept custom parameters for performance data including time ranges and ways to cluster shot types. The output will include custom and useful error messages as well as graphs and tables for performance data.
\subsection{Shooting Mechanism}
The Shooting Mechanism will be the subsystem which fires the ball towards the user. A microcontroller will be used as the point of contact and set any actuators required to fire a specified shot. It must complete this action within 1.5 seconds for the Computer Vision to detect the ball returned by the user. \\\\
The Shooting Mechanism will consist of three main sub parts: Automatic Feeder, Automatic Panning, Ball Shooter. The functionality of the Automatic Feeder part will be to automatically control the feeding rate of the table tennis balls into the shooting barrel and feed the balls into the barrel as initiated by the program. The functionality of the Automatic Panning will be to rotate the entire shooting mechanism or the shooting barrel about the z-axis so the mechanism is able to cover all of the shooting zones as specified in the requirements. Additionally, the functionality of the ball shooter is actually shoot out table tennis balls from the shooting barrel. Please refer to figure \ref{fig:shootingmechanismoutline} for visual representation. \\\\
In terms of electrical components, Arduino UNO microcontroller will be used to control all of the IPO (Input Process Output) processes between the sensors, actuators and Smart Serve. For the ball shooter, a DC Motor will be used as the system will require high speeds and high torques to shoot out table tennis balls. The details on the DC motor can be found below in Table \ref{table:motorspecs} (SAYAL Electronics SKU No. 230437). The DC Motor will be controlled using the PWM method for speed control. Additionally, a Stepper Motor will be utilized for the automatic feeding of the balls into shooting barrel functionality as the Stepper motor would not require any position encoder as well as the stepper motor will have predictable movements. Details on the stepper motor can be found below in Table \ref{table:feedermotorspecs} (Grobotronics SKU No. 19-00012858). For the automatic panning part of the shooting mechanism, a servo or a stepper motor will be utilized however that would be further refined after rigorous prototyping and simulations. Please refer to Figure \ref{fig:electricalwiringdiagrambb}, Figure \ref{fig:electricalwiringdiagramschematic}, and Figure \ref{fig:electricalwiringdiagrampcb} for an overview of Electrical Bread Board, Schematic and PCB layout diagrams of how the Shooting Mechanism system outline.

\section{Class Responsibility Collaboration (CRC) Cards}
The following sections will include one CRC card for each subsystem. A CRC card contains information pertaining to which requirements a subsystem is responsible for and which subsystems one would collaborate with. This will be used for testing purposes and to track where a given requirement is satisfied. A requirement does not have to be satisfied completely by one subsystem, but a majority of the work must be done by that subsystem.

\section{Communication Protocols} % Chris
\subsection{SmartServe to Shot Recommendation}
The SR will use Python to leverage machine learning libraries like SciKit Learn and the SS will be implemented in Java. In order for the SS to communicate to the SR, it will make an HTTP request with some data and receive an HTTP response encoded using JSON. This allows the use of a reliable means of communication and flexibility to host the SR remotely if need be. \\ \\
The SS will make a GET request to the SR for requesting a shot to use and can make POST request to give data regarding whether a shot was returned or not. In the event the HTTP request takes too long, the SS should handle it accordingly by timing out and using random shots or continuing the program. \\ \\
HTTP libraries are standard in Java and a microframework for handling HTTP requests can be used for Python like \href{http://flask.pocoo.org}{flask}.
\subsection{SmartServe to Shooting Mechanism}
The SM will implement an interface using an Arduino. The SS will use libraries for communicating to the Arduino to communicate to the SM which can be found \href{http://fizzed.com/oss/rxtx-for-java}{here} for 64-bit Windows and Linux installations and \href{http://blog.iharder.net/2009/08/18/rxtx-java-6-and-librxtxserial-jnilib-on-intel-mac-os-x/}{here} for 64-bit macOS installations. The SS does not need a response from the system, as it will tell the SM where to shoot and how to do so but does not need a response.
\subsection{SmartServe to Computer Vision}
The SS will communicate to the CV via sockets over the TCP protocol using the Java Networking libraries and the Python socket libraries. The SS will initiate the communication to start tracking and expect a return value based on whether it was returned or not. The SS will timeout in the event the CV does not return a value after 1.5 seconds.
\subsection{SmartServe to User Interface}
The SS and the User Interface subsystem (UI) will both be programmed using Java. The UI system can interface with the SS by calling exposed public methods based on user input.
\subsection{SmartServe to ShootingModel}
The SS and the SModel will both be programmed using Java. The SS system can interface with the SModel by calling exposed public methods based on user input.
\subsection{SmartServe to Data Storage}
The SS is programmed in Java and the DS will be implemented using Stored Procedures held in a MySQL database instance. In order for the SS to use the DS, a \href{https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/5.1.html}{SQLConnector} can be used to do so.
\subsection{Shot Recommendation to Data Storage}
The SR is programmed in Python and the DS will be implemented using Stored Procedures held in a MySQL database instance. In order for the SR to use the DS, a \href{https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/}{SQLConnector} can be used to do so.

\section{Hardware Design}
\subsection{Mechanical Components}
\subsubsection*{Shift Adapter}
The shaft adapter is designed to fit snugly on the stepper motor shaft and provides a more robust connection with the \textit{spinning feeder cutout}. The shaft adapter is designed to allow the feeder cutout to sit at a precise height where it could rotate without any obstructions and push the table tennis balls into the \textit{Inner Tube}. The shaft adapter will bring the spinning feeder cutout to a height such that the contant point of the ball is in the middle (biggest diameter of the ball).

  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}

\subsubsection*{Panning Control}
The functionality of the Automatic Panning will be to rotate the entire shooting mechanism or the shooting barrel about the z-axis so the mechanism is able to cover all of the shooting zones as specified in the requirements. \\ \\
The components designed for the panning stage include an acrylic base plate, a rapid prototyped worm wheel gear ring, the worm, and a motor bracket. The base plate clearance mounting holes were made using a workshop drill press / milling machine. The rapid prototyped stepper motor bracket is mounted to the base plate and adjusted so that correct gear engagement is achieved. The Lazy Susan bearing is positioned 10 mm above the plate using spacers and longer \#6?32 screws, washers, and nuts. The worm gear is designed as a ring shape to reduce rapid prototyping material consumption. A corresponding hole pattern mates to the top plate of the Lazy Susan bearing. The optical switch is used to home the system at power up and align the system in the direction required with a reference and from there on the system will always be aware of its position. Optical switches allow for high repeatability making it a very applicable sensor to use in the prototype.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Spinning Feeder Cutout}
The spinning feeder cutout is fixed to the shaft of the stepper motor inside the bucket to guide the table tennis balls into the \textit{Inner Tube}. The cutout is laser cut from a thin and sturdy sheet of wood so it has enough thickness (contact surface area) to easily push the table tennis balls around. There will be a lot of balls going in and out of the feeder cutout continuously so it has the sharp edges to hold the ball in once its captured and 45mm diameter semi circles to easily allow the 40mm table tennis balls to slide into the pockets.

   \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{img/6.jpg} % requires the graphicx package
   \caption{Feeder Cutout from topview for laser cutting  }
   \label{fig:hw6}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Inner Tube}
The inner tube is designed to hold table tennis balls to be shot out by the shooting mechanism, as well as have solid support hold the shooting mechanism pipe structure. The diameter of the inner tube is 45mm to allow the ball to be easily fed into the tube but restrict jittering when traveling through the pipe.

   \caption{CAD design of a Inner Tube }
   \label{fig:hw7}
\end{figure}

 
\subsubsection*{Motor Bracket and Outer Tube}
A custom designed motor bracket is used to mount the DC motor onto the outer PVC tube to create our preliminary shooting mechanism. The motor has a cylindrical housing thus making it difficult to fix onto anything especially onto another cylindrical object, the Outer Tube. The motor has to be mounted securely and tightly to minimize the vibrations into the shooting mechanism which could translate onto the entire system.

    \caption{Motor with Motor Bracket attached to the Outer Tube }
  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}

\subsubsection*{Roll Control}
The roll control part will act as a manual control for the user to decide the type of spin to give the table tennis ball for the current session. The roll control part acts as the male end of a locking mechanism, which will fix the shooter in either a 0, 90, 180, or 270 degree angle. With the roll control settings, the user will be able to manually change the roll setting to experience a topspin, backspin, and left or right spin.The roll control part will be fixed on the base end of the inner shaft of the shooter. The outer shaft of the shooter will then be able to lock into the desired position.

  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}

\subsubsection*{Base, Support Brackets and Bucket}
The base is made out of a hardwood and laser cut to an appropriate size. The base acts as a fixture to attach the bucket supports to the azimuth stage. There are two metal support brackets which are made out of stainless steel, and lift the bucket to an appropriate height above the base. The bottom of the supports are screwed into the hardwood base, and the top of the supports are bolted to the bucket. The bucket is 8in x 7in and is large enough to hold at least 20 balls without overfilling.

    \caption{Bucket with Inner Tune and Roll Control attached }
  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}

\subsubsection*{Pitch Control}
The pitch control consists of a screw that pierces through the support beam and bucket, to hold the shooter at a certain angle. The range of angles are as followed: -15,0,15,30,45, and are set by pre drilled holes in the bucket. This design needs to be optimized with a bolt in order to further secure the pitch and eliminate error.

\end{center}

\subsection{Electrical Components}
\subsubsection*{Stepper Motors}
We chose a Japan Servo KP35FM2-035 stepper motor for the panning assembly because of its torque and step accuracy. To make the panning smooth as possible the motor provides 200 steps per revolution (1.8 degrees per step) from this stepper is sufficient for our purposes. The max torque is 700 g/cm at 24 VDC / 500mA but due to microcontroller restrictions and we are only using a torque of approximately 250g/cm to operate at a around 9VDC. At this lower voltage the stepper motor combined with the worm gear train provides enough torque to move the system (panning) at a sufficient speed.
A gear stepper motor (model 28BYJ48) with a driver is utilized for the automatic feeding of the balls into shooting barrel functionality as the stepper motor would not require any position encoder as well as the stepper motor will have predictable movements. This motor generates 300 g/cm torque at a voltage of 5VDC. This motor will be continuously running during the operation of the system at varying speeds and a ball will enter the Inner Tube at every quarter turn of the Feeder Cutout. The stepper has 64 steps per revolution (5.625 degrees per step) so every 16 steps the stepper moves, a ball will be fed into the feeder. This low-step count motor is good for our purposes because it allows the stepper to function at higher RPMs than other higher step count similar frame size motors.

\end{figure}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}

\subsubsection*{DC Motors}
For the ball shooter, a DC Motor purchased from Sayal Electronics and Hobbies is used as the system will require high speeds and high torques to shoot out ping pong balls. The DC motor operates between 3-6 volts, can reach a max RPM of 17,000, has a 2mm shaft diameter and max torque of 20.72 g/cm. Although the table tennis balls don't account for much weight the motor torque needs to be sufficient enough so that the wheel attached to the shaft can push on the ball, make contact and toss it out as required speeds. The DC Motor will be controlled using the PWM method for speed control.

\end{minipage}
\end{center}

\subsubsection*{Arduino}
Arduino UNO microcontroller is used to control all of the IPO (Input Process Output) processes between the sensors, actuators and Smart Serve. Arduino is chosen because it has a hardware platform setup and allows programming and serial communication over USB so designing so a PCB is not necessary. It is fast for our purposes, there is a lot of libraries available to use and lots of hardware modules designed for Arduino UNO. Also, this microcontroller easily interfaces with the hardware used in this prototype.
