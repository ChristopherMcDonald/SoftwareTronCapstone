## Overview
SmartServe is an autonomous table tennis training system for table tennis players with various skill levels. SmartServe aids in diagnosing and improving a player's performance over time. The system trains table tennis players by shooting table tennis balls towards the player and detects successful returns from the player. The system can further adapt to the player's weaknesses and help them overcome it through further training. Importantly, SmartServe alleviates the problems of finding and working with a coach for players, as well as coaches trying to train multiple players simultaneously. The system will be deemed a success if the table tennis players and coaches, can enjoy and see a value added by using SmartServe.

The project started at the beginning of the Fall 2017 academic term and will conclude at the end of the Winter 2018 term. In addition, the core project team consists of final year Software and Mechatronics Engineering students who are enrolled in the MECHTRON 4TB6/SFWRENG 4G06 capstone project course.
